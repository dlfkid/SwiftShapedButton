# SwiftShapedButton
A swift translation of ole's OBShapedButton. Thanks for his contribution, Get it here: https://github.com/ole/OBShapedButton.git 

Now I am using swift to construct another app and it's require for shaped buttons, so I did a little translate work for OBShapedButton framework.

The button only response touch event as you taped inside its image shape.
